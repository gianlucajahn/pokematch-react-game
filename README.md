## What I learned üìö
- using component lifecycle hooks such as the useEffect hook to work with components throughout their lifespan
- refactoring code to fit the "Automatic Batching" approach of React State, including state updater functions
- using cleanup functions to improve an application's performance and prevent unintended side effects

## Motivation
My motivation in building this project was to learn more about functional components and the way they handled component lifecycles, which mostly reside in useEffect hooks. I certainly bumped into some issues when starting out and that's perfectly good, because that way I learnt why those issues occured, learnt to fix them and how to prevent them from happening in the future - more on that in the **"What I learned"** tab.
